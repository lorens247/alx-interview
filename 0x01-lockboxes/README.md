## Concepts

### Lists and List Manipulation
- Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.
  - [Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

### Graph Theory Basics
- Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory (especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) can be very helpful in solving this problem, as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.
  - [Graph Theory (Khan Academy)](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms)

### Algorithmic Complexity
- Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms.
  - [Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-of-algorithms-set-1-asymptotic-analysis/)

### Recursion
- Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.
  - [Recursion in Python (Real Python)](https://realpython.com/python-thinking-recursively/)

### Queue and Stack
- Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.
  - [Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-in-python/)

### Set Operations
- Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.
