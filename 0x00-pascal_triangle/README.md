# Pascal's Triangle and Python Algorithms

## Pascal's Triangle

### What is Pascal’s Triangle?
Pascal’s Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients, named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two directly above it. It has many applications in mathematics, including combinatorics, probability theory, and number theory.
