## Introduction
This README.md file discusses the concepts and skills required to tackle the Minimum Operations problem. Understanding these concepts will aid in devising efficient solutions to solve the problem effectively.

## Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming is a crucial technique for breaking down complex problems into simpler subproblems and building up the solution iteratively. Familiarity with dynamic programming concepts, such as memoization and tabulation, can significantly enhance problem-solving skills.

## Prime Factorization
Prime factorization is essential for solving the Minimum Operations problem efficiently. By decomposing the target number into its prime factors, one can determine the minimum operations required to reach the target. Understanding prime factorization algorithms and techniques is crucial for devising an optimal solution.

## Code Optimization
Code optimization plays a vital role in improving the efficiency and performance of solutions. Knowing how to optimize code by reducing time and space complexity is essential for solving computational problems effectively.

## Greedy Algorithms
Greedy algorithms offer an alternative approach to solving optimization problems by making locally optimal choices at each step. Understanding greedy algorithms and their applications can provide insights into devising efficient solutions for the Minimum Operations problem.

## Basic Python Programming
Proficiency in Python programming is fundamental for implementing solutions to the Minimum Operations problem. Knowledge of Python syntax, data structures, control flow mechanisms, and functions is essential for writing clean and concise code.
