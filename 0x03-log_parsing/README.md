## Overview

Log Parsing" project! This project revolves around parsing and processing data streams in real-time using Python programming. The main objective is to read from standard input (`stdin`), handle data in a specific format, and perform calculations based on the input data. This README aims to guide you through the essential concepts and resources you'll need to successfully complete this project.

## Concepts Needed

### 1. File I/O in Python

- **Reading from sys.stdin:** Understand how to read data from the standard input line by line.
  - Resource: [Python Input and Output](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html)

### 2. Signal Handling in Python

- **Handling keyboard interruptions:** Implement signal handling in Python to manage keyboard interruptions, such as CTRL + C.
  - Resource: [Python Signal Handling](https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html)

### 3. Data Processing

- **Parsing strings:** Extract specific data points from the log entries.
- **Aggregating data:** Compute summaries or metrics based on the processed data.

### 4. Regular Expressions

- **Validating log entry formats:** Use regular expressions to ensure that each log entry adheres to a specific format.
  - Resource: [Python Regular Expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)

### 5. Dictionaries in Python

- **Counting occurrences:** Utilize dictionaries to count the occurrences of status codes and accumulate file sizes.
  - Resource: [Python Dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)

### 6. Exception Handling

- **Handling exceptions:** Implement exception handling to manage possible errors during file reading and data processing.
  - Resource: [Python Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)

## Getting Started

To begin working on the log parsing project, familiarize yourself with the above concepts and resources. Additionally, ensure you have a Python environment set up on your machine.

## Project Structure

- **`main.py`:** This is the main Python script where you'll implement the log parsing logic.
- **`utils.py`:** Utility functions and helper methods can be placed here to keep the main script clean and organized.
- **`README.md`:** This file provides an overview of the project, necessary concepts, and resources.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Execute the `0-stats.py` script using a Python interpreter.
4. Follow the instructions within the script to input log data via `stdin` and observe the parsed results.

## Conclusion

By studying and applying the concepts outlined in this README, you'll be well-equipped to tackle the log parsing project effectively. Remember to practice parsing log entries, handling data streams, and computing metrics based on the processed data. If you encounter any issues or have questions, don't hesitate to refer to the provided resources or seek assistance from the community. Happy coding!
